            <p> <strong> "Bullying" </strong>is a term often used loosely, but understanding what constitutes bullying
                is crucial. How does one distinguish between being a bully or being bullied?
            </p>
            <p>According to the widely acknowledged definition, bullying involves: "Bullying is characterized by
                intentional and repetitive aggressive behavior that is meant to cause harm or distress to others."</p>

            <p>
                In essence, any deliberate and recurring harmful behavior towards another person falls under bullying.
                There are various forms of bullying encountered, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Verbal Bullying</li>
                <li>Physical Bullying</li>
                <li>Cyber Bullying</li>
                <li>Social Bullying</li>
                <li>Emotional Bullying</li>
            </ul>


            <p>If you suspect someone is being bullied or is at risk, there are steps you can take to support them.
                Encourage them to open up about their experiences, either to you or a professional counselor, and if
                possible, report the bullying.</p>

            <p>If You Are Being Bullied. . . First and foremost, recognize that you are not alone, and the bullying is
                not your fault. If you are facing bullying, it's essential to seek assistance and support.</p>

            <h3>Support</h3>
            <p>In situations of bullying, connecting with an advocate or counselor who can provide guidance and access
                to available services is vital. Bullies often isolate their targets, making them feel ashamed and alone,
                leading to confusion and difficulty in decision-making. Many individuals experiencing bullying describe
                a loss of identity, making it harder to cope.</p>

            <p>Local organizations and support programs offer a range of services for individuals facing bullying. These
                services can include counseling, safe spaces for discussion, legal advocacy, community support, and
                more. Joining support groups provides a safe environment to share experiences and emotions without
                judgment and facilitates interaction with others who've undergone similar challenges.</p>

                    various contexts. </p>
