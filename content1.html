            <p> “Abuse” is a word that is thrown around a lot in casual conversion; but what defines abuse? How does one
                know if they are committing abuse or if they are being abused? The abuse definition is actually quite
                simple. According to the Gale Encyclopaedia of Medicine, the definition of abuse is the following:"Abuse
                is
                defined as any action that intentionally harms or injures another person."
                In short, someone who purposefully harms another in any way is committing abuse. There are many kinds of

            <p>If you think a friend is being abused or is at risk of harm, there is a lot you can do to help them. You
                should encourage them to talk about it, either to you or to a trained counsellor, and if possible,
                report
                the abuse.</p>

            <p>If you are being abused emotionally, physically or sexually, it is important to tell someone. There is no
                shame in asking for help.If You Are Being Abused. . .
                First and foremost, know that you are not alone and that the abuse is not your fault.
                If you are experiencing abuse, harassment, or harm from your partner, or think that you might be, help
                is
                available</p>

            <h3>Support</h3>
            <p>If you are experiencing domestic violence, it is important to get connected with an advocate who can
                provide
                support, referrals, and provide you with available services. Abusive partners are usually very good at
                isolating their partner from family and friends. As a result, victims may feel ashamed and alone and
                believe
                that no one would understand. Many survivors have described feeling as if they didn’t know who they were
                anymore. This makes it even more difficult to survive the abuse, to sort through feelings, and to make
                decisions that will be best for you and your children.</p>

            <p>Local domestic violence programs offer a variety services to provide support to survivors of domestic
                violence. Check your local program, as services vary and may include emergency shelter, transitional
                housing, legal advocacy, childcare, counseling, support groups, and more. Support groups offer a safe
                place
                to talk about your feelings and experiences in an atmosphere free of judgment. It’s also an opportunity
                to
                meet and talk with other people who have had similar experiences.</p>

            <h3>Planning for Safety</h3>
            <p>If you think you might be experiencing abuse, harassment, or harm, it is important to make a plan to keep
                yourself as safe as possible. Here are some things to consider:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Think about what you can do to keep yourself physically safe.</li>
                    <li>Establish a code word or signal with trusted friends or family so they know when you're in
                        danger.</li>

                </ul>
                <li class="li-title">Social Support:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify who you can talk to on a social level, such as friends or family.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>What can you do to keep yourself distracted? Can you go for a walk, watch TV, listen to music,
                        scream into a pillow, cry it out?</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>What can you say to yourself to help get you through the moment?</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="li-title"> Emergency Services: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consider calling emergency services or going to the hospital if you feel like you are still
                        unsafe or need help</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="li-title">Educate yourself:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn about resources available in your community, such as shelters, counseling services, and
                        legal
                        assistance.</li>
                </ul>

                <li class="li-title">Seek professional help:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> Consult with a therapist, counselor, or support group to help process the emotional aspects of
                        the
                        situation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Remember, the most effective safety plans are ones that speak to the individuals using them, ones
                    that are personalized and practical. It’s also important to involve school authorities and trusted
                    adults in the process. </p>
